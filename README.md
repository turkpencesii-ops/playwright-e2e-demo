# Playwright E2E Demo (UI + API)

This repo demonstrates my approach to modern test automation with Playwright:
- Stable UI end-to-end checks (positive + negative)
- API validations using Playwright request
- CI execution via GitHub Actions

## Why these tests
I automate stable, business-critical flows for regression confidence.
Volatile UI areas are intentionally excluded to keep automation reliable.

## Run locally
npm ci
npm test
